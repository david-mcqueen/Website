                  Hello, I'm Dave. I'm a software engineer based in the north west of England, and I rather enjoy writing code. I work in a software house based in Manchester, and use my freetime to learn new langauges and develop mobile applications across a variety of domains.
                    I also enjoy running, reading, and talking science.

                    I have liaised with less technical Project Managers to build a harmonious relationship with technical developers, as well as mentoured newer members of the development team.

                        I spear-headed the migration from TFS into git, preserving the entire commit history. In addition, I developed in my spare time an in-house testing application to streamline the testing process, providing a greater overview of affected areas, and to help deliver a more robust product.

                        Initially starting work at Web Applications UK on a placement year between year 2 and year 3 of my degree, I was offered a full time position as a software engineer upon graduation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I worked within the development team to create bespoke travel reservation systems, working to the customers specification to ensure that desired functionality was delivered to schedule.
                        The product development lifecycle required technical input throughout, ensuring that the overall best solution was delivered to the customer.
                        This required me to provide quotes for upcoming work, assistance for developers who were working on tasks for which I was the lead engineer, liaison between all team members involved in a project, testing of deliverables to ensure they met the specification, and also deployment to the customer after signoff in UAT.

                        Developed in my spare time, this browser based application was created to stramline the existing testing process at my employer, Daviker. 
                        The application allows for comprehensive regression testing, providing realtime testing progress & status to be provided to the team when we are conducting our pre-release testing.
                        The test results are aggregated, allowing for multiple people to provide feedback on the same area, and presented in a clean concise summary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The development of this application helped to streamline the testing process, and reduce the amount of manual collation & processing of the test results, allowing for more time to be spent testing and fixing any found bugs.

                    <p>
                        This application was built with a KnockoutJS frontend, with a .net core and PostgreSQL backend.

                            Pulser is an audible heart rate monitor, connecting directly to your Bluetooth (BLE) device to provide you constant updates as to how hard you are pushing your heart. Know when you are at your peak, and know when you can give that little bit extra and set a new personal record. Hear your heart, and reach your training goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pulser was created after noticing that some activity trackers failed to provide realtime audible data on the users heart rate, even though it was being tracked. Pulser is written natively in Swift, and integrates seamlesly with activity trackers to achieve the best of both worlds.
                        </p>
      
                        <p>
                            I no longer publish Pulser to the app store, however Pulser is an open source project allowing users to fork the project and create the own incarnation of the app.
